                <p>One of the things I was taught early on in my career was that "If you are talking about the Canadian Armed Forces you should stick to what you KNOW." So lets do that, lets jump right in.</p>

              <li><strong>How to follow effectively</strong>
                <br>
                <p>These days there are hundreds of articles on how to be a better leader, but nobody wants to discuss how to be a follower. 
                    The truth is that not everyone wants to be a leader, or can be, and that’s OK! In fact, how can you lead people if you don’t know
                     how they should follow you? The core of being a good follower is being able to distinguish when you are involved in the decision-making 
                     process and when you are not. Providing your input and expertise can be critical for a team leader to make the right call, but once that 
                     decision has been made it is vital for supporters to fall in and trust in their leader. Continuing to voice hesitations can be fractious to 
                     team cohesion and deadly for morale. Instead, trust your lead and promote the rest of the team’s trust in her as well!

                <li><strong>It's not a popularity contest</strong></li>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It’s great working in an environment where everyone gets a long, goes for beers after work and develops friendships outside of the office. 
                    But what if there are members of the team that you just don’t or CAN’T get along with? It can be easy to obsess over differences, employ every
                     tactic possible to turn your team into something out of a LinkedIn article. But before you waste your energy be sure to correctly identify the problem.
                      Is there something about the situation that is hindering your or the team’s productivity? Is this a problem for the team or is it a problem for you as an 
                      individual? Letting go of the need to be the ideal teammate who is liked by everyone can save you sanity and your manager sanity. It’s not a popularity 
                      contest!

                <li><strong>Giving means getting</strong></li>
                <br>
                <p>
                        Everyone has heard of that idiom “blah blah, stones and glass houses… blah blah.” We all have unique perspectives, often that can give us insight 
                        into projects or people. It’s easy to feel like we should share those ideas… for the betterment of the project or whatever. Recognize however, that 
                        when others criticize your own work it is coming from that same place. I dislike that idiom because it seems to discourage us from lobbing the proverbial 
                        criticism-stone for fear of reciprocation, rather we should all just stop building our houses from glass! Remember that you judge others based on their 
                        actions, but give yourself the kindness of judging yourself based on your intentions.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Compromising does not necessarily mean failure</strong></li>
                <br>
                <p>
                        Today we are promising ourselves that we can have everything. We just need to “lean in” or download this new app or subscribe to that service. 
                        It’s easy to see why sometimes compromising can feel bad. It’s important to de-couple mission critical items with “nice-to-haves”. This can be tricky to accomplish, 
                        but it comes back to clearly thinking about your team’s mission statement, and the values that underpin it. Delaying a response to a request in order to provide more 
                        accurate information may be a compromise to an email response policy, but hastily replying without fact checking can have dire consequences.
