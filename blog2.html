                                My career began in 2012, shortly after graduating from McGill. I went to basic training, learned everything there is to know about aircraft electronics, and began working on the CC177-GlobemasterIII (pictured above). During my 6 years of service, I traveled
                                all over the world as a Technical Air-Crew Member. Here's a bit of what I learned.

                                    <p>These days there are hundreds of articles on how to be a better leader, but nobody wants to discuss how to be a follower. The truth is that not everyone wants to be a leader, or can be, and that’s OK! In fact, how can
                                        you lead people if you don’t know how they should follow you? The core of being a good follower is being able to distinguish when you are involved in the decision-making process and when you are not. Providing your
                                        input and expertise can be critical for a team leader to make the right call, but once that decision has been made it is vital for supporters to fall in and trust in their leader. Continuing to voice hesitations
                                        can be fractious to team cohesion and deadly for morale. Instead, trust your lead and promote the rest of the team’s trust in her as well!

                                    It’s great working in an environment where everyone gets a long, goes for beers after work and develops friendships outside of the office. But what if there are members of the team that you just don’t or CAN’T get along with? It can be easy to obsess
                                    over differences, employ every tactic possible to turn your team into something out of a LinkedIn article. But before you waste your energy be sure to correctly identify the problem. Is there something about the situation
                                    that is hindering your or the team’s productivity? Is this a problem for the team or is it a problem for you? Letting go of the need to be the ideal teammate who is liked by everyone can save your sanity and your manager's
                                    sanity.

                                    Everyone has heard of that idiom “Something something, stones and glass houses… blah blah.” We all have unique perspectives, often that can give us insight into projects or people. It’s easy to feel like we should share those ideas… for the betterment
                                    of the project. Recognize however, that when others criticize your own work it is coming from that same place. I dislike that idiom because it seems to discourage us from lobbing the proverbial criticism-stone for fear
                                    of reciprocation, rather we should all just stop building our houses from glass! Remember that you judge others based on their actions, but give yourself the kindness of judging yourself based on your intentions.

                                <li><strong>Compromising does not necessarily mean failing</strong></li>

                                    Today we are promising ourselves that we can have everything. We just need to “lean in” or download this new app or subscribe to that service. It’s easy to see why sometimes compromising can feel bad. It’s important to de-couple mission critical items
                                    with “nice-to-haves.” This can be tricky to accomplish, but it comes back to clearly thinking about your team’s mission statement, and the values that underpin it. Delaying a response to a request in order to provide
                                    more accurate information may be a compromise to an email response policy, but hastily replying without fact checking can have dire consequences.
